This code runs a monitoring and control system that includes PIR sensors, gas sensors, ultrasonic sensors, an LCD, and servo motors. The system uses sensors to detect motion, gas concentration, and distance, including a PIR sensor and servo for garage use, a gas sensor for gas leak detection, an ultrasonic sensor for room detection, a water level sensor for monitoring water levels, and an ultrasonic sensor for gate opening and closing. The setup method initializes pins and components, whereas the loop function updates sensors and actuators in response to sensor data. The key characteristics are motion detection, gas detection, distance measuring, and water level monitoring.
