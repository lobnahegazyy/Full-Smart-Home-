This code manages a monitoring and control system involving PIR sensors, gas sensors, ultrasonic sensors, a LCD, and servos. The system detects motion, gas concentration, and distance using sensors, with the PIR sensor and servo for garage use, the gas sensor for gas leak detection, the ultrasonic sensor for room detection, the water level sensor for water level monitoring, and the ultrasonic sensor for gate opening and closing. The setup function initializes pins and components, while the loop function updates sensors and actuators based on sensor readings. Key features include motion detection, gas detection, distance measurement, and water level monitoring.
